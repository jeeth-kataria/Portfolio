The "Landon Norris" Style Master Prompt
Role & Objective:
You are an expert Frontend Architect and UI/UX Designer. Your goal is to build a personal portfolio website for Jeeth Bhavesh Kataria inspired by the "Bento Grid" aesthetic of landonorris.com. The site must be responsive, highly performant, and use a dark, high-contrast engineering theme.

Design System (The "Landon" Vibe):

Layout: A "Bento Box" Grid System. Everything (About, Projects, Socials, Stats) lives inside modular, rounded-square cards.

Theme: Deep Black (#050505) background. Cards are slightly lighter (#101010) with subtle borders (#1f1f1f).

Typography: Large, bold Sans-Serif headings (Inter or Geist Sans) mixed with Monospace tags (JetBrains Mono) for technical details.

Interactions: Hover effects are key. Cards should slightly scale up or glow on hover. Images inside cards should have a subtle zoom effect.

Navigation: Floating dock or simple top-right links.

Tech Stack:

Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router).

Styling: Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (for the layout transitions).

Icons: Lucide React.

Font: Inter & JetBrains Mono (via next/font).

Content & Grid Architecture (The Bento Layout):

Row 1 (The Hook):

Card A (Large - 2x2): Hero Card.

Text: "I build high-performance AI systems."

Subtext: "Jeeth Bhavesh Kataria. Researcher & Systems Engineer."

Visual: A subtle, animated mesh gradient or 3D abstract shape (using Three.js or simple CSS gradient animation).

Card B (Tall - 1x2): The "Visual Resume" (Trajectory Graph).

Content: Display the Jeeth_Kataria_Academic_Trajectory.png image here.

Overlay/Caption: "Academic & Research Trajectory."

Action: Click to expand/view full size.

Card C (Small - 1x1): Location.

Icon: Map Pin.

Text: "Bengaluru, India."

Visual: A mini interactive Mapbox or just a stylized static map image.

Row 2 (The Proof):

Card D (Wide - 2x1): Featured Project: torch-kitsune.

Badge: v0.3.0 PyPI CUDA

Headline: "Accelerating PyTorch."

Desc: "CUDA-accelerated dataflow scheduler. Optimizes memory & reduces overhead."

Link: External arrow to PyPI.

Card E (Small - 1x1): Competitive Stats (The "Brain" Card).

Headline: "Top 1% Engineering."

Stat 1: "JEE Mains 2023: 97.98%le (AIR 23k)."

Stat 2: "NEET 2023: AIR 32k."

Style: Bold numbers, very clean typography.

Card F (Small - 1x1): Stack.

Icons only: Python, C++, PyTorch, CUDA, Next.js, Docker. (Marquee animation if possible).

Row 3 (Experience & Research):

Card G (Wide - 2x1): Research Timeline.

List Layout (Minimal):

"DRDO (Defense R&D) – Research Intern" (Right arrow)

"Samsung Vision – PRISM Researcher" (Right arrow)

"CMTI (Govt) – ML Intern" (Right arrow)

Card H (Wide - 2x1): System Architecture (SIH).

Headline: "Marine Intelligence."

Desc: "Multi-Agent RL System for Ocean Anomaly Detection."

Visual: A small diagram or abstract wave animation.

Footer / Social Row:

Card I (Small): GitHub (Large Icon).

Card J (Small): LinkedIn (Large Icon).

Card K (Medium): "Email Me" (Button style card).

Implementation Instructions:

Set up a BentoGrid component using CSS Grid.

Use framer-motion for layoutId animations (so cards feel fluid).

Ensure the "Trajectory Graph" card (Card B) handles the image aspect ratio gracefully (object-cover).

The "Competitive Stats" card should use a monospace font for the numbers to emphasize precision.

Make it fully responsive: On mobile, the grid collapses to a single column stack.
